<p>Arch Cotttage is wheelchair accessible - please check specific requirements before booking. It's 2 miles from Penrith and junction 40 and 4 miles from Pooley Bridge, so perfect for an overnight break from a journey, a week's holiday enjoying the delights of the Lake District or anything in between. It has a double bedroom and another with a single bed and a pull-out bed. There's a lift to the top floor. The bathroom has both bath and walk/roll-in shower. There's a kitchen, dining area and lounge. Please be aware that the house is very close to the West Coast Main Line from London to Scotland. If you're a light sleeper hoping to get a good night's sleep, this place is not for you. But The Grotto, where Arch Cottage is situated, is a very quiet area other than for the trains. Up to date availability can be found on the calendar on the Airbnb website, linked to below. I can offer you a better price if you then contact me directly to book.</p>
