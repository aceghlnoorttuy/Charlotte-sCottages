    <h1>House Manual</h1> 
<h2>Check In/Checkout</h2>


<p>Check in is from 3 pm and check out is by 10 am.</p> 

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you find that anything is missing or you need more information about anything, please contact Charlotte or Bob on 01768 840963, 07517464506 or 07447995915. You’ll be lucky to get mobile reception at the house, but if you go up to the end of the drive, you should be able to send a text or make a call.</p>



<h2>Hot water</h2>

<p>If you want to use the shower, first pull the cord in the bathroom to switch the orange light on. Hot water for the rest of the property is controlled by the immersion, the switch for which is in the airing cupboard in the bathroom. It is set to constant and you can switch it on when you arrive then switch it off before you leave.</p>
<h2>Heating</h2>

<p>The apartment is heated by electrical, wall mounted radiators. Unless it is a cold day, we will leave them off for your arrival. They can be set to come on automatically, but we have not done this. To use the manual mode, switch them on at the plugs. The panel will display Pr:Hd. Press the hand symbol and the temperature of the room will be displayed. Use the arrow keys to select the temperature you want then press ok. The display will show the room temperature again, with a blue dot next to it, showing that the radiator is heating up. Please do not leave radiators on at a high temperature when you go out.</p>
<h2>Keys</h2>

<p>The front door is opened by the bronze key; also on the key ring are keys for the two doors which open onto the garden. When you leave, after locking all doors, please leave the keys locked in the key safe.</p>

<h2>Rubbish</h2>

<p>If you use more than one bin bag, please leave full bags in the shed in the garden. A private company takes away rubbish and they sort it for recycling, so you can just dispose of everything in the bin. </p>

<h2>Oven</h2>

<p>Turn on the switch on the wall. Select temperature and oven setting, using dials. Press the clock icon on the left a couple of times and the oven will come on.
    
<h2>Hob</h2>

<p>Ensure that the oven switch on the wall is on. Find the symbol which is a circle with a vertical line in it; touch this to turn the hob on. Now touch the symbol which has four circles in it as many times as necessary to select the hot plate which you want to use. Now, to select the temperature, use the + and – symbols.</p>
    
<h2>Wi-fi</h2>

<p>The hub number and password are written on the back of the hub.</p>

<h2>Lightbulbs and batteries for remote controls</h2>

<p>These will be checked between each stay, but if you find a light or control not working during your stay, please contact us using the above numbers.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>After any guest, The Granary is always cleaned and checked ready for the next guest. However, we do expect you to leave the property tidy and reasonably clean. There are cleaning materials in the under-stairs cupboard, should you need to use any of them.</p>
